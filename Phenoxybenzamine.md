- ==Non specific==, long acting ==irreversible== ==alpha antagonist==
- MOA: 
	- covalent bond with α receptors 
	- blockade of alpha receptor (lasts for 3 – 4 days)
- Also ==blockade of 5-HT, histaminergic and [[cholinergic receptors]]==
- Clinically: 
	- ==Postural hypotension==
	- venodilatation>arteriolar
- Blood flow to many organ increased due to reduction in peripheral resistance and increased venous return
- Shifts blood from pulmonary to systemic circulation
- Shifts blood from extravascular to vascular compartment
- [[Central nervous system (CNS)|CNS]] stimulation 
	- nausea, vomiting on IV [[Parenteral (via injection)|injection]] 
	- [[Oral (口服用藥)|oral]] doses cause depression, tiredness and lethargy
- Adverse effects
	- Postural hypotension
	- Impaired ejaculation ( ejaculation mediated by sympathetic nervous system )
	- Stuffy nose ( increase secretions ) due to vasodilation effect
	- Induce reflex tachycardia
