- NSAID anti-inflammatory activity: 
	- inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis 
	- inhibition of chemotaxis, down-regulation of IL-1 production, decreased production of free radicals and superoxide, and interference with calciummediated intracellular events
- Selective COX-2 inhibitors 
	- do not affect platelet function 
	- improve GI safety 
	- increase the incidence of [[水腫 (edema)|edema]], hypertension, myocardial infarction.
- Biliary excretion and reabsorption (enterohepatic circulation) Metabolism: 
	- liver P450 enzymes: 
		- CYP3A or CYP2C→ renal excretion highly protein-bound (∼98%, albumin)
