- An increase in the rate of solution does not mean an increase in the amount of solute
- The rate of solution depend on: 
	- particle size of the solute:
		- ↑ surface area ↑ rate of solution 
	- agitation:
		- by moving around the more concentrated solution and less concentrated solution 
	- temperature: 
		- ↑ temp. ↑ rate of solution
