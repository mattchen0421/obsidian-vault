- Ideal solvent for pharmaceutical use 
	- Good solubility and dispersity of the solutes 
	- Stable, no interaction with the active ingredient 
	- No effect on the efficacy of drug and its content measurement 
	- Low toxicity, odorless 
	- Low cost 
- **Water** 
	- the solvent most widely used as a vehicle for pharmaceutical products, including organic compounds, inorganic salts, sugars, proteins, etc.
	- Miscibility with other solvents, such as alcohol and glycerin 
- **Alcohol (ethyl alcohol) 乙醇** 
	- good for many organic substances, plant constituents (resins, volatile oils, alkaloids, glycosides, etc) 
	- Greater stability than water 
	- Often diluted with water in preparation
- **Dehydrated alcohol (absolute alcohol) 無水乙醇** 
	- Practically free from water $\rightarrow$ has a greater range of solvent power 
- **Isopropyl alcohol 異丙醇** 
	- Similar properties to ethyl alcohol but with higher toxicity 
	- Use as a solvent in cosmetic and dermatologic formulations 
- **Glycerin 甘油** 
	- Miscible with both water and alcohol, but not CHCl<sub>3</sub> , ether, or fixed oils 
	- Excellent solvent for tannins, phenol, and boric acids 
	- Must be heated to reduce viscosity before use 
	- used as a stabilizer for solutions prepared with other solvents. 
- **Propylene Glycol 丙二醇** 
	- Miscible with water, acetone, alcohol, and CHCl<sub>3</sub> 
	- Soluble in ether and will dissolve many essential oils, but immiscible with fixed oils 
	- Used as a replacement for glycerin
- **Polyethylene Glycol 400 聚乙烯二醇400** 
	- Miscible with water, alcohol 
	- Can dissolve many water soluble or water insoluble organic compounds 
- **Ethyl oxide (solvent ether) 乙醚** 
	- Miscible with alcohol, benzene, CHCl<sub>3</sub> , solvent hexane, fixed and volatile oils 
	- Highly volatile and flammable; its vapor may explode when mixed with air and ignited 
	- Good solvent for oils, fats, resins, and many alkaloids 
- **Chloroform (CHCl3 ) 氯仿** 
	- Miscible with alcohol, benzene, ether, solvent hexane, fixed and volatile oils 
	- Not flammable but its vapor decomposed by naked flames and producing harmful gases 
	- a solvent for many alkaloids
- **Petroleum Benzin (solvent hexane) 石油本清** 
	- Immiscible with water but miscible with dehydrated alcohol, ether, CHCl<sub>3</sub>, and most fixed and volatile oils 
	- Highly flammable 
	- Use for the removal of unnecessary fats from certain drugs prior to the extraction of active ingredients 
- **Carbon tetrachloride 四氯化碳(CCl<sub>4</sub>)** 
	- Very slightly miscible in water but miscible with common organic solvents 
	- Non flammable 
	- Dissolve fats and oils 
- **Acetone 丙酮**  
	- Miscible with water, alcohol, ether, CHCl<sub>3</sub>, and most volatile oils 
	- Flammable but does not involve the danger of explosion that exists with ether
