## Solutions
- “a one-phase system of two or more substances” 
- a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances 
- homogeneous:
	-  when the molecules of solute are uniformly distributed 
- Solution (溶液) = solute (溶質) + solvent (溶劑or溶媒): 
	-  Solute is present in the smaller amount 
	-  Solvent is present in the larger amount 
	-  Exception: syrup BP: 66.7 w/w % sucrose (solute) + 33.3 % water (solvent) 
- Any phase of matter (gas, liquid, or solid) can dissolve into any other phase
- In physical and chemical terms, solutions may be prepared from any combination of solid, liquid, and gas. 
- In pharmaceutical terms, solutions are “liquid preparations that contain one or more chemical substances dissolved in a suitable solvent or mixture of mutually miscible solvents”. The solute is usually solid or liquid. 
	- Classified based on administration routes:
		- oral, otic, ophthalmic, or topical, injections, etc. 
	- Classified according to dosage forms:
		- syrups, elixirs, spirits, aromatic waters, etc

## [[Pharmacopoeia 藥典]]
## ⭐Classification of solutions 藥典所列溶液劑劑型
- **[[aromatic waters (芳香水劑)]]**:
	- solutions of aromatic materials if the solvent is aqueous 
	- the simplest formulation dosage form 
	- volatile solute + solvent water 
- **[[syrups (糖漿劑)]]**: 
	- aqueous solutions containing sugars 
	- Formulated preparations containing pharmaceutical necessities or adjuvants to improve “elegance” of the product 
	- “Elegance” 
		- stable, palatable, and therapeutically effective
- **[[spirits (醑劑)]]**: 
	- solutions of aromatic materials as the solvent is alcoholic 
- **[[elixirs (酏劑)]]**: 
	- sweetened hydroalcoholic (alcohol + water) solutions 
- **[[tinctures (酊劑) and fluidextracts (流浸膏劑)]]**:
	- Solutions prepared by extracting active constituents from crude drugs are termed  or **fluidextracts (流浸膏劑)**, depending on their method of preparation or concentration. 
- **Injections**:
	- sterile and pyrogen free; intended for parenteral administration

## [[Solutions as an oral dosage form]]
## ⭐Water
- Water is the most important solvent for pharmaceutical solutions 
- In U.S.P., it is classified according to its degrees of purity: 
	- **Water** 
		- not for preparation use 
	- **Purified water 純淨水 or 精製水** 
		- Prepared from distillation, ionize exchange, or reverse osmosis 
	- **Water for injection 注射用水** 
		- Preparation from distillation or reverse osmosis, no additives 
		- Used as solvents for injection 
	- **Sterile water for injection 滅菌注射用水** 
		- Pyrogen free, sterilized, double-distilled water, no additives 
	- **Bacteriostatic water for injection 抑菌注射用水** 
		- Containing one or more preservatives and store in glass vial (<30mL) 
		- Need to pass bacterial endotoxin test 
		- Need to label “ Not for use in newborns
