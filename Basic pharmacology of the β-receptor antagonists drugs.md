- Decrease in Heart rate, decrease in cardiac output, decrease in force of contraction
- Prolongs systole 
	- synergy of contraction disturbed in ventricles
- Not prominent in Normal persons, but in presence of sympathetic over activity (exercise, emotion)
- Cardiac work and oxygen consumption - reduced
- Total coronary flow reduction (aortic pressure) 
	- subepicardial region but not subendocardial region 
	- benefit in angina
- Delayed AV conduction l At high doses membrane stabilizing and direct depressant action
