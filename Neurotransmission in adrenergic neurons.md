1. **synthesis of [[Norepinephrine]]** 
	- hydroxylation of tyrosine is the rate-limiting step
	- ![[Pasted image 20230326232918.png\|300]]
2. **uptake into storage vesicles**
	- [[dopamine]] enters a vesicle and it converted to [[Norepinephrine]] 
	- [[Norepinephrine]]  is protected from degradation in vesicle 
	- transport to vesicle is inhibited by ==reserpine==
3. **release of neurotransmitter**
	- influx of calcium causes fusion of the vesicle with the cell membrane in a process known as exocytosis
	- release is blocked ==guanethidine== and ==bretylium==
4. **binding to receptor**
	- Postsynaptic receptor is activated by the binding of neurotransmitter 
5. **removal of [[Norepinephrine]]** 
	- released [[Norepinephrine]] is rapidly taken into the neuron
	- reuptake is inhibited by ==[[cocaine]]== and ==imipramine==
6. **metabolism**
	- [[Norepinephrine]] is methylated by COMT and oxidized by MAO
