- Most gas species can dissolve in liquids to some extent. 
-  While gas is only slightly soluble, the solubility, by weight, of the gas is very nearly proportional to the pressure if the temperature remains constant (Henry’s law). 
- The solubility of a gas is influenced by temperature. ↑ temperature will ↓ solubility 
- Salting out(鹽析):
	-  when a salt is added to a liquid containing a dissolved gas (eg, add NaCl to soda), a liberation of the gas occurs due to decreased solubility of the gas
