## Extraction process
- The crude plant or animal tissue contains active principles of medicinal interest such as alkaloids, glycosides, tannins, resins, and oils. Associated with them are a variety of complex mixtures of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. 
- A variety of procedures and solvent systems can be applied to provide efficient extraction with maximum selectivity. 
- Process of extraction: 
	- A solvent system penetrate into cellular material by diffusion and dissolve the desired constituent with a minimum of undesired materials 
	- Reduce particle size of crude is preferred
## Two official extraction processes
### Percolation (滲濾法, 滲漉法)
- The most popular method of extraction for the preparation of tinctures, fluidextracts, and extracts 
- The process involves packing the drug into a column (percolator), and then collecting the extracted material dissolved in the solvent 
- This method extracts principles with minimum solvent 
- A maceration period in the percolator can increase the extraction efficiency
### Maceration (浸漬法)
- Crude drug is placed into a solvent system (with or without heat) and the mixture allowed to stand with occasional agitation for an extended period. 
- The system is then filtered to remove undissolved materials (marc, 殘渣), and a sufficient quantity of solvent (menstruum, 浸溶劑) is added to the filtrate to a desired volume. 
- Suited for crude drugs with little or no soft cellular tissue, such as benzoin. 
- The extended periods during which crude drug and solvent are in contact allow for sufficient solvent penetration
## Extraction
- Other processes 
	- Not official methods 
	- Decoction (煎法) 
	- Digestion (溫漬法) 
	- Infusion (浸法) 
- Extraction products 
	- Tinctures (酊劑) 
	- Fluidextracts (流浸膏劑) 
	- Extracts (浸膏劑) 
		- not liquid formulation (will not be discussed in this section) 
	- Resins (樹脂) 
		- not liquid formulation (will not be discussed in this section)
# Tinctures (酊劑)
- Alcoholic or hydroalcoholic solutions of principles extracted from natural sources or of pure chemicals merely dissolved in these solvent systems. 
- The amount of active ingredient in tinctures varies for different products 
	- Potent medication(劇藥):
		- each mL contains ==0.1g== of active drug 
		- Example of potent medication:
			- barbital, bromine, [[Penicillins|penicillin]], etc 
	- Less potent drugs(普通藥品):
		- each mL contains ==0.2g== of active drug 
	- From crude(新鮮生藥):
		- each mL contains ==0.5g== of crude
# Fluidextracts (流浸膏劑)
- Liquid preparations containing extracted principles from vegetable drugs prepared in such a way that ==each mL== contains the therapeutic constituents of ==1g of crude drug==.
- Percolation is preferred because of the exhaustive extraction required 
- Rate of percolation (滲漉速率) 
	- Slow: 
		- for 1000g crude drug, <1mL/min 
	- Medium: 
		- for 1000g crude drug, 1-3mL/min 
	- Fast: 
		- for 1000g crude drug, 3-5mL/min
## Preparation processes
- A: 
	- exhaustive percolation with an alcoholic or hydroalcoholic solvent. >1000mL solvent for 1000g crude drug 
- B: 
	- use more than one solvent for percolation; 
	- eg., alcohol (or water-alcohol mixtures) + glycerin 
- C (fractional or divided percolation分段滲漉法): 
	- for use in drugs cannot be heated
	- eg., 1000g crude drug is divided into 500, 300, and 200 g portions, and each portion is percolated separately 
- D: 
	- differs from A and B only in that boiling water is used as the solvent 
- E (pressure percolation加壓滲漉法):
	- modified from C
- ==No official fluidextract listed use B, C, or E process==
## 流浸膏_中華藥典
### 定義
適當浸溶劑抽提，所製得的含乙醇液體製劑。
每mL所含之有效成分，相當於標準生藥1g。
### 製備
1. 均係以滲漉法製備之。製備所得之稀滲出液，須用低溫蒸發濃縮，濃縮時之溫度應保持在60°以下。
2. 製備流浸膏之滲漉器，通常以使用圓筒形滲漉器為最適宜，但所用藥品遇浸溶劑過於膨脹者，則以使用廣口式滲漉器為宜。
### 儲藏
密閉阻光容器至於低溫處。
流浸膏貯置相當時間後，常有沈澱發生，可予過濾。
### 測定
- 生藥中若有成分不耐熱：
取細粉生藥粉末1000g，分為500g、300g、200g
- 第一份500g：
收集最初滲出液200ml，再分別收集滲出液5分，每份300ml
- 第二份300g：
用第一份收集的五份滲出液為浸溶劑，先用一份300ml濕潤，再加入其他四份
收集最初滲出液300ml，再分別收集滲出液5分，每份200ml
- 第三份200g：
用第二份收集的五份滲出液為浸溶劑，先用一份濕潤，再加入其他四份
- 若無需測定含量，收集滲出液500ml，和前面第一第二份滲出液混合，共成1000ml
- 若需測定含量，僅收集滲出液420ml，和前面第一第二份滲出液混合，取一部分做含量測定
