- Adrenergic neurons
- Adrenergic neurons release NE as the primary neurotransmitter
- Found in the [[Central nervous system (CNS)|CNS]] and sympathetic nervous system and act as link between the ganglia and effector organs.
- Adrenergic drugs act on adrenoreceptors (activated by NE) that locates on either the ==presynaptic== membrane or ==postsynaptic== membrane.
- So, Neurotransmitter of the adrenergic neurons is NE
