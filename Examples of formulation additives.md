### Buffers 
- pharmaceutically acceptable buffering systems include:
	- carbonates, citrates, gluconates, lactates, phosphates, or tartrates. 
	- Borates are only for external use
### Density modifiers 
- spinal anesthetics 
### Isotonicity modifiers 
- for injection use 
	- e.g., dextrose and NaCl 
	- Isotonicity adjustments can only be made after the addition of all other ingredients 
### Viscosity enhancement 
- povidone, hydroxyethylcellulose, and carbomer
### Preservatives 
- Requirement:
	- no adsorption onto the containers, its efficiency is not impaired by the pH of the solution 
	- e.g., parahydroxybenzoic acid esters 
### Reducing agents and antioxidants 
- Reducing agent:
	- sodium metabixulphite 
- Antioxidants:
	- butylated hydroxyanizole or butylated hydroxytoluene 
### Sweentening agents 
- Low MW carbohydrates
	- eg, sucrose 
- Polyhydric alcohol
	- eg, sorbitol, mannitol, glycerol, etc 
- Artificial sweeteners
	- Na or Ca salts of saccharin (E954), aspartame (E951), acesulfame potassium (E950), thaumatin (E957), sodium cyclamate (E952), and neohesperidine DC (E959)
