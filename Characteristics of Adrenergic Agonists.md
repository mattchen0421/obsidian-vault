## Medicinal Chemistry of Sympathomimetic Drugs
### Substitution on the Benzene Ring
- Maximal α and β activity is found with catecholamines, ie, drugs having –OH groups at the 3 and 4 positions on the benzene ring.
- The absence of one or the other of these groups dramatically reduces the potency of these drugs
### Substitution on the Amino Group
- Increasing the size of alkyl substituents on the amino group tends to ==increase β-receptor activity==.
	- e.g. [[Isoproterenol]]  >[[Epinephrine]]  > [[Norepinephrine]] 
### Substitution on the Alpha Carbon
- Substitutions at the α carbon  block oxidation by monoamine oxidase (MAO), thus prolonging the duration of action of these drugs
- e.g. ==ephedrine== and ==amphetamine==
### Substitution on the Beta Carbon
- Direct-acting agonists typically have a β-hydroxyl group, although ==dopamine== does not.
- In addition to facilitating activation of adrenoceptors, this hydroxyl group may be important for storage of sympathomimetic amines in neural vesicles.
