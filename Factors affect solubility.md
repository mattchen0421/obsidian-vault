### Molecular structure 
- The relative strength of solute-solute and solvent-solvent intermolecular forces vs solvent-solvent intermolecular forces often determines the solubility. “like dissolves likes” 
### Temperature 
- ↑kinetic energy tend to breakdown intermolecular interactions often allowing the solution process to occur easily. (Exception: gas) 
- In general, solids have higher solubility in higher temperature 
- Endothermic reaction 吸熱反應:
	- ↑ temp. ↑ solubility
- Exothermic reaction 放熱反應: 
	- ↑ temp. ↓ solubility 
	- methylcellulose and calcium salts are more soluble in cold water than in hot 
- water – NaCl – has same solubility at 25oC and 100oC
### pH 
- Many drugs are either weak acids or weak bases, and their aq. solubility are dependent to the pH of the solvent 
- pH = pKa + $\log\frac{S - S_{0}}{S_{0}}$
- Weak acid: 
	- ↑ pH ↑ solubility 
	- eg. Barbiturates and sulfonamide 
- Weak base:
	- ↓ pH ↑ solubility 
	- Eg. Alkaloids and local anesthetics 
	- only slightly dissolve in water but will convert to a water-soluble salt by the addition of an acid 
### Other substances in solution (formulation additives) 
- Slightly soluble electrolytes:
	- ==add second salt ↓ solubility==
- Nonelectrolytes:
	- salting out or salting in 
- ==Iodine==:
	- very slightly soluble in water. But when it is added to a concentrated potassium iodide solution, it dissolves immediately. 
- Buffers, density and isotonicity modifiers, viscosity enhancement
