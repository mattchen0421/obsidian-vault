- Nonselective agonist of α and β adrenoreceptors
- At higher doses, α effects dominate
- At lower doses, β effects dominate
- Receptor stimulation: α1 = α2 = β1 = β2
- Hyperglycemia: 
	1. Epi
	2. increased glycogenolysis in the liver (β<sub>2</sub> effect)
	3. increased release of glucagon (β<sub>2</sub> effect), and a decreased release of insulin (α2 effect). 
	- These effects are mediated via the cAMP mechanism.
- Lipolysis: 
	1. Epi
	2. β receptors of adipose tissue
	3. adenylyl cyclase
	4. increase cAMP levels
	5. hormone-sensitive lipase
	6. hydrolyzes triacylglycerols to free fatty acids and glycerol
## Adverse effects
- CNS disturbances:  
	- can produce adverse CNS effects that include anxiety, fear, tension, headache, and tremor.
- Hemorrhage: 
	- The drug may induce cerebral hemorrhage as a result of a marked elevation of blood pressure.
- Cardiac arrhythmias: 
	- particularly if the patient is receiving digitalis.
- Pulmonary edema:  
	- can induce pulmonary edema
- drug Interactions:
	- ==cocaine== 
		- increased duration
- Hyperthyroidism 甲亢: 
	- Epinephrine may have enhanced cardio-vascular actions in patients with hyperthyroidism
- Diabetes: 
	- Epinephrine increases the release of endogenous stores of glucose. In the diabetic, dosages of insulin may have to be increased
- β-Blockers: 
	- These agents prevent epinephrine's effects on β receptors, leaving α-receptor stimulation unopposed
- Inhalation anesthetics: 
	- Inhalational anesthetics sensitize the heart to the effects of epinephrine, which may lead to tachycardia
