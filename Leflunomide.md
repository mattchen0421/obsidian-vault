## Mechanism:
- Leflunomide➔active metabolite, A77 1726: inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase ➔ lead to decreased ribonuclease synthesis, arrest of cells in the G1 phase of cell growth. ➔ inhibits T-cell proliferation, reduces B-cell antibody production, increases IL-10 receptor mRNA, decreases IL-8 receptor mRNA, and decreases TNFα–dependent NFKβ activation. 
## Indications: 
- RA (=MTX), lupus nephritis, giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, dermatomyositis, and myasthenia gravis. 
## Adverse Effects: 
- Diarrhea, hepatotoxicity
