- **solubility (溶解度)**:
	-  The maximum amount that can be dissolved into a particular solvent to form a stable solution at a specified temperature 
- **saturated (飽和)**:
	-  a solution that is at the solubility limit 
- **unsaturated (未飽和)**:
	-  anything that is less than saturated 
- **supersaturated (過飽和)**:
	- a solution that contains more than the solubility limit.
	- E.g., potassium acetate, sodium thiosulfate 
- **dilute**:
	- a solution that contains relatively little solute 
- **concentrated**: 
	- a solution that contains relatively amount of solute 
- **aqueous solution (水溶液, aq.)**:
	- a solution in which water is the solvent
