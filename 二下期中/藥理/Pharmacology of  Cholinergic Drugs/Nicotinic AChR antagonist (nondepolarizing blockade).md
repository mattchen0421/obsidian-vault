aliases: Nicotinic AChR antagonist

## Non-depolarizing (competitive) blockade 
- ==Antagonize nicotinic AChRs directly==.
- Relaxation of skeletal muscles with longer duration.
- Prevent spontaneous movement of muscle during surgical operations. 
- Paralyze muscles required for breathing (the diaphragm), mechanical ventilation should be available to maintain adequate respiration. 
- ==Curare (arrow poisons)==, crude extract from certain South American plants; originally brought to Europe by explorers.
- The muscular paralysis effect of nondepolarizing nAChR blockers “==can==” be reversed by AChE inhibitors. 
- ==Only works if the poison gets into the bloodstream==; ingesting curare (even eat the meat of curare-poisoned animals) has no toxic effect since it “cannot” be absorbed in the stomach (positive charged)
- it has been found that the potency of ==tubocurarine== was related to the separation distance between the two quaternary ammonium heads. Further research led to the development of synthesized molecules with different curariform activity, depending on the distance between the quaternary ammonium groups

## duration of action
- Short acting compounds (rapidly degraded):
	- ==Mivacurium==. 
- Intermediate duration agents: 
	- ==Vecuronium==, ==Rocuronium==.
- Very long lasting agents:
	- ==Tubocurarine==, ==Pancuronium==
## Properties of nAChR antagonists
- In general, larger muscles (ex. abdominal, trunk, diaphragm) are more resistant to non-depolarizing NMJ blockade and recover more rapidly than smaller muscles (ex. facial, foot, hand). So, the diaphragm is usually the last muscle to be paralyzed and regained function first after discontinued of drugs.
- ==Tobocurarine==, ==mivacurium==, and ==atracurium== can induce hypotension result from ==increasing in systemic histamine release==.
- ==Pancuronium== may cause ==increase in heart rate and cardiac output==.
- Drugs that stimulate histamine release may also induce “==bronchospasm==”.
## Nicotinic AChR blockade at autonomic ganglion
- Ganglionic blockers specifically act on the nicotinic receptors of both parasympathetic and sympathetic autonomic ganglia.
- Nondepolarizing, competitive nicotinic AChR antagonists. 
- ==Mecamylamine== and ==Trimethaphan== are administered when ganglionic blockade is desired. 
- The only clinical application for these agents is “==acute aortic dissection==” induced hypertensive emergency. These drugs lower the blood pressure and simultaneously prevent reflex tachycardia (sympathetic)
