- [[Acetylcholine]] as the major neurotransmitter
	- Depolarization of the motor neuron end plate induce the release of [[Acetylcholine]]
	- Binding of ACh with the postsynaptic ACh receptors cause postsynaptic depolarization termed end-plate potential (EPP)
	- EPP trigger a propagating action potential throughout the muscle fiber and produce the muscle contraction
