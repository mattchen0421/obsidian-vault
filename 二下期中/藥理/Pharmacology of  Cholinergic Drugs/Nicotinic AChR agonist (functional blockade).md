## Succinylcholine (Suxamethonium)

^dfd60f

- more resistant to cholinesterase at synapse
- The only nAChR agonist with clinical application
	- Used to induce paralysis during surgery
	- facilitate tracheal intubation
- Succinylcholine produces profound blockade within 60s
- blockade starts to recover within 3 min
### Depolarizing blockade
- Phase I: brief period of excitation → widespread fasciculation of muscle. 
- Phase II: maintain the cell membrane in a depolarized condition that inactivate the sodium channel and desensitize of nAChRs → flaccid paralysis of muscle fibers
- can ==not== be reversed by AChE inhibitors.
### Side effects
- Cardiovascular effects
	- bradycardia
- Malignant hyperthermia
	- with halothane
- Muscle pain
- Increased serum potassium
- Hypersensitivity
- Increased intra-ocular pressure
- Increased intragastric pressure
- Prolonged paralysis
