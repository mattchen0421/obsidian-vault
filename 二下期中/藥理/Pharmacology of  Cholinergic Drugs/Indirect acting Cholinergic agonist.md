## Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
- All AChE inhibitors target the enzyme by binding to the active “Esteric site” of the enzyme. 
- Divided into three classes of agents based on their pharmacokinetic properties toward AChE (Reversibility of binding)
### Edrophonium (simple alcohols)
- reversibly associating with the active site of the enzyme. (5-15 min)
### Carbamic acid esters
- form a labile covalent bond between drug and enzyme. (~few hours)
### Organophosphates

^9b5387

- form a extremely stable complex bond with AChE. (>100 hours) 
- Almost irreversible, so the body must synthesize new AChE to restore its activity. 
- Treatment:
	- [[Atropine]]
	- cross BBB, reduce the [[Central nervous system (CNS)|CNS]] stimulating effect of [[acetylcholine]]
- ==Pralidoxime==
	- as an ==antidote for Organophosphates poisoning==. 
	- Bind with AChE at “anionic site” that change the structure of the complex and release the enzyme
