## Increase the transmission at [[Neuromuscular junction (NMJ)|neuromuscular junction]]
- ==[[Myasthenia Gravis]]==:
	- autoantibodies against ACh receptors,
	- induce the internalization of the receptors â†’ muscle weakness.
- ==Lambert-Eaton syndrome==:
	- autoantibodies against presynaptic calcium channels. 
	- AChE inhibitors (such as pyridostigmine) improve the symptoms of weakness. 
	- Shorting acting AChE inhibitors, Edrophonium can be used for diagnosis.
## Increase the parasympathetic tone
- Topical application of AChE inhibitors to the cornea of the eye can reduce intra-ocular pressure: 
	- treatmeat of glaucoma 
	- Ex. Physostigmine 
- $\uparrow$ Gastrointestinal tract smooth muscle motility 
	- treatment of ileus and abdominal distention 
	- Ex. Neostigmine
- Reversing of [[Central nervous system (CNS)|CNS]] side effects induced by certain anti-cholinergic poisoning
	- Ex. Physostigmine
## Enhancement of cholinergic activity in the [[Central nervous system (CNS)|CNS]]
- Treatment of Alzheimer's disease, brain injury or other neurodegenerative diseases induced dementia. 
- **Tacrine**: 
	- The first AChE inhibitor approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, rarely used recently due to ==hepatotoxicity==. 
- **Donepezil**: 
	- Reversible AChE inhibitor, approved by FDA for the treatment of severe ==Alzheimer's disease==. 
- **Rivastigmine**: 
	- FDA approved for the treatment of ==Parkinson's disease== associated dementia.
- **Galantamine**: 
	- An alkaloid, as a competitive and reversible AChE inhibitor.
- Side effects: 
	- Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping are related to peripheral parasympathomimetic effects on the GI tract.
