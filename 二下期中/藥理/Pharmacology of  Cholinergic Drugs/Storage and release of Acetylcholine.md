## Source of choline: 
- 35~50% ==from acetylcholinesterase==. 
- Lipid phosphatidylcholine from plasma.
- Phospholipids: phosphorylcholine 
- Rate-limiting step for ACh synthesis is the availability of choline.
	- Passive diffusion (slow, non saturable)
	- Sodium dependent transporter (high affinity, but easily saturated)
## Storage of ACh in the vesicles
- Uptake of ACh into the vesicles by the ACh-H<sup>+</sup> antiporter
## Release of ACh into the synaptic cleft
- Presynaptic terminal depolarization that results in calcium influx. 
- Ca<sup>2+</sup> induce binding of synaptotagmin to SNARE complex.
- Vesicle fusion to the plasma membrane and release of ACh
