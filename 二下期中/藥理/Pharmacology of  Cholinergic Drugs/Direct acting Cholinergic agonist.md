## [[Acetylcholine]]
- Endogenous neurotransmitter;
- no selectivity for muscarinic vs. nicotinic receptors.
- Rapid metabolism by AChE. 
- Limited therapeutic or diagnostic value.
## Methacholine:
- ==More resistant== to AChE;
- ==mAChR selective==
- Cause bronchoconstriction that been used for the ==diagnosis of asthma==.
## Carbachol:
- Carbamoyl group provide resistance to AChE that extends duration of action
- In addition to muscarinic agonist effect, also has enhanced nicotinic action which may result in non-specific effect at autonomic ganglion.
- ==Not suitable for systemic purpose==.
- Topical application as a miotic agent for the treatment of ==glaucoma==, decrease the intraocular pressure.
## Bethanechol:
- Carbamoyl group provide resistance to AChE that extends duration of action
- ==Selective for muscarinic ACh receptors==. 
- Tissue selective for GI and urinary bladder, used for promoting GI and urinary tract motility in postoperative, postpartum and drug-related urinary retention(類副交感活化)

## Muscarine:
- Highly charged with poor GI absorption and penetration to the [[Central nervous system (CNS)|CNS]]. 
- Low [[bioavailability]]
## Pilocarpine:
- Broadly used in clinic. 
- Miotic agent:
	- ==first== treatment of ==glaucoma==.
- Saliva-inducing agent: 
	- treatment of xerostomia (dry mouth)
