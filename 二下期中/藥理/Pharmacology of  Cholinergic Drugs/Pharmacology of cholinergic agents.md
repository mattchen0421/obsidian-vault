- Complex actions of [[Acetylcholine]] (parasympathetic function, autonomic ganglion, and [[Central nervous system (CNS)|CNS]] effects) make it difficult to display selective effects.
- Factors affecting the function of cholinergic agents: 
	1. Receptor binding affinity, Ex: Pirenzepine, M1 selective. 
	2. Resistance to degradation, Ex: Methacholine, resistance to AChE degradation, longer duration of action. 
	3. Poor Blood-brain barrier penetration of some charged drugs,
		- Ex: Muscarine, no [[Central nervous system (CNS)|CNS]] effects. 
		- In contrast, lipophilic agents, 
		- Ex: Physostigmine with high [[Central nervous system (CNS)|CNS]] penetration, as the first choice of treating [[Central nervous system (CNS)|CNS]] effects of anticholinergic overdose
