## Sites of Cholinergic Transmission
- The release process can be modulated by the transmitter itself and by other agents through activation of specific receptors located on the ==pre junctional membrane==
- e.g. noradrenaline (NA) release is inhibited by NA ( Î±<sub>2</sub> receptor).

- Following its combination with the receptor, the transmitter is either locally degraded (e.g. ACh) or is taken back into the prejunctional neurone by active uptake or diffuses away (e.g. NA, GABA).
## Reuptake
- Sympathetic nerves take up amines and release them as neurotransmitters
- **Uptake I** 
	- is a high efficiency system more specific for NA
	- Located in neuronal membrane
	- Inhibited by ==[[Cocaine]], TCAD, [[Amphetamine]]==
- **Uptake 2**
	- is less specific for NA
	- Located in smooth muscle/ cardiac muscle
	- Inhibited by ==steroids/ phenoxybenzamine==
	- No Physiological or Pharmacological importance
