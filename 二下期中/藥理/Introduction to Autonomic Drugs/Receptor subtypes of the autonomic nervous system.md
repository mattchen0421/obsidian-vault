## [[Acetylcholine]] 
- [[cholinergic receptors]]  
- Muscarinic Receptors
- Selectively stimulated by Muscarine and blocked by [[Atropine]] 
	- all are G-protein coupled receptors
- Primarily located in heart, eye, smooth muscles and glands of GIT
- Autoreceptors (M type) are present in prejunctional cholinergic Nerve endings – also in adrenergic nerve terminals leading to vasodilatation when ACh is injected
- **Blood vessels**: 
	- All blood vessels have muscarininc receptors although no cholinergic innervations
- Pharmacologically - M1, M2, M3, M4 and M5
- M4 and M5 are present in certain areas of Brain and regulate other neurotransmitters
- M1, M3 and M5 fall in one class, while M2 and M4 in another class
- However till today, ==M1, M2 and M3 are major ones== and present in effector cell and prejunctional nerve endings in [[Central nervous system (CNS)|CNS]]
- All subtypes have little agonist selectivity but selective antagonist selectivity
- Most organs usually have more than one subtype but one subtype predominates in a tissue.
