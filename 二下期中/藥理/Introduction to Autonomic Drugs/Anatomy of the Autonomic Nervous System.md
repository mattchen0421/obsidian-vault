## Cholinergic and Adrenergic System
- Cholinergic Drugs
	- act by releasing [[acetylcholine]]
	- But also utilize nitric oxide (NO) or peptides for transmission
- Noradrenergic
	- commonly called “adrenergic” Drugs 
	- act by releasing [[norepinephrine]] (NA)
## Sites of Cholinergic Transmission
- [[Acetylcholine]] (Ach) is major neurohumoral transmitter at autonomic, somatic and [[Central nervous system (CNS)|central nervous system]]
- All preganglionic sites
- All Postganglionic Parasympathetic sites and sympathetic to sweat gland
- Skeletal Muscles
- [[Central nervous system (CNS)|CNS]]: Cortex Basal ganglia, spinal chord and others

## Enteric Nervous System
- Considered 3rd Division of ANS
- Auerbach's plexus or myenteric plexus
- Meissner's plexus or submucous plexus
- May be excitatory or inhibitory in Nature
- Parasympathetic as a whole is excitatory (pre and post ACH) while sympathetic is relaxant (preganglionic Ach inhibition)
- Stimulation of these neurones causes release of – Ach, NE, VIP, ATP, Substance P, ==5-HT(serotonin)== etc.
