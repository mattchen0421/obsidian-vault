- Block action of Ach on nicotinic receptors
- Interfere with postsynaptic transmission of Ach (non-selective)
## Depolarizing agents
- activation $\rightarrow$ deactivation $\rightarrow$ inactivation
- Nicotine
## Competitive blocking agents
- Different subtypes of nicotinic receptors exist at ganglia and neuromuscular junctions
- Trimethaphan
### Physiological effects depend on the system within the autonomic system that exerts dominant control over that organ
## Effect
- ==心臟, 血管, 腸胃, 眼睛==

- Ganglion-blocking drugs are not used due to severe adverse effects. They were important historically for the beginning of successful treatment of ==hypertension==
- They were used in hypertension is for initial control of blood pressure in patient with acute dissecting aortic aneurysm.
- The reasons are:
	1. reduce blood pressure
	2. inhibit sympathetic reflexes and thereby reduce the rate of pressure rise at the site of the tear
