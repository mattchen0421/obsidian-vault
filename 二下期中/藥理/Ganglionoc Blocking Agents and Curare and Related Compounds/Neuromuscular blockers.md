## Mechanism of skeletal muscle contraction
![[Pasted image 20230323094332.png]]
![[Pasted image 20230323094417.png]]
## 
- Skeletal muscle consists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors whereas smooth muscle  consists of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors !!
## differ from each other in
- Mechanism of action
- Duration of action
- Speed of onset  and offset of action
- Selectivity of action and safety margin
- Adverse effects
## Depolarizing
- acts as nicotinic agonist and induces depolarization. Because skeletal muscle tension can not be maintained without repolarization/depolarization of the endplate, continuous depolarization results in muscle relaxation
	- [[Nicotinic AChR agonist (functional blockade)#^dfd60f|Succinylcholine]]
- Decrease in Ach release
	- [[Drugs target acetylcholine#^815646|botulinus toxin]]
### Therapeutic Use
- adjuvant drugs in surgical anesthesia
- Endotracheal intubations 
	-  use one with a short duration of action
- In the intensive care unit to prevent high airway pressure, decrease oxygen consumption and abolish muscle rigidity in patients on ==mechanical ventilation==
- In Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)(驚厥電震治療) of psychiatric disorders
	- prevent bone fractures
### Pharmacology
- duration of action is short (several minutes) because it is rapidly broken down by plasma cholinesterases (must be administered by continuous infusion)
### Adverse Effects
- when administered with ==halothane== some genetically susceptible people (inherited autosomal dominant condition) experience ==malignant hyperthermia==. 
	- Treatment: rapid cooling of the body and ==dantrolene==
## Nondepolarizing (competitive)
- ==Tubocurarine==
### Mechanism
- bind to nicotinic receptor and competes with acetylcholine
- Because of the competitive nature of the postsynaptic blockade, transient relief of the block can be achieved by  increasing ACh levels at the synaptic cleft 
	- i.e. use cholinesterase inhibitors
### Therapeutic Use
- adjuvant drugs in surgical anesthesia
### Pharmacology
- Must be given by ==injection== because they are poorly absorbed orally.  ==Do not cross the BBB==. Generally excreted unchanged (i.e. not metabolized)
### Adverse Effects
- ==Tubocurarine causes release of histamine from mast cells== 
	-  decrease in blood pressure, bronchospasms, skin wheals.  Newer generation don’t
### Drug Interactions
- **Cholinesterase Inhibitors** 
	-  decrease the effectiveness of nondepolarizing agents
- **Aminoglycoside antibiotics** (e.g. streptomycin) 
	- decrease ACh release by competing with Ca<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup>
	-  increase action of nondepolarizing drugs
- **Calcium channel blockers** 
	- increase the actions of nondepolarizing drugs by decreasing the amount of ACh released 
	- increase action of nondepolarizing drugs
- **Halogenated carbon anesthetics** (e.g. isoflurane) 
	- enhance neuromuscular blockade by
		- decreasing excitability of motoneurons,
		- increasing muscle blood flow
		- decreased kinetics of AChRs (increase action of nondepolarizing drugs)
## Action at autonomic ganglia
- d-tubocurarine blocks $\rightarrow$ hypotension $\rightarrow$ reflex tachycardia  
- succinylcholine may stimulate (bradycardia, bronchial secretions)
- newer agents have less ganglionic effects
## Adverse Effects/Toxicity
- Respiratory paralysis 
	- neuromuscular blockers induce a respiratory paralysis. If mechanical ventilation is not provided, the patient will asphyxiate (窒息)
- Malignant hyperthermia (succinylcholine + halothane)  
	- Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, an autosomal dominant disorder of skeletal muscle, is one of the main causes of death due to anesthesia. Depolarizing neuromuscular blocking drugs (succinylcholine) can trigger malignant hyperthermia.
	- Malignant hyperthermia is a result of ==excessive release== of Ca<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> from sarcoplasmic reticulum.
	- The clinical features of malignant hyperthermia are hyperthermia, metabolic acidosis, tachycardia, accelerated muscle metabolism and contractures.
	- ==Dantrolene== is used to treat malignant hyperthermia. Dantrolene blocks Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, reduces heat production and muscular tone
- Hypotension
- Decreased tone and motility in GI tract
- ==Depolarizing agents can cause increased K efflux in patients with burns, trauma, or denervation and lead to hyperkalemia==
	- ==cardiac arrhythmias and arrest==
- Prolonged apnea (long-term use)
- Sinus bradycardia/junctional rhythm (with succinylcholine)
## Drug Interactions
- ==Cholinesterase Inhibitors (antagonize competitive and enhance depolarizing)==
- Inhalational Anesthetics (synergistic)
- Aminoglycoside Antibiotics (synergistic)
- Calcium Channel Blockers (synergistic)
