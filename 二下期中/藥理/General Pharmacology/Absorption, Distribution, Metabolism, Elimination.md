## Routes of drug administration
1.  Enteral
	- [[Oral (口服用藥)|Oral]]: The most common route of administration.
	- [[Oral mucosal routes|Sublingual]]
	- [[Rectal route|Rectal]]
2. [[Parenteral (via injection)|Parenteral]]: Used for drugs that are poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract
	- Intravascular (IV): The most common [[Parenteral (via injection)|parenteral]] route.
	- [[Intramuscular (IM)|Intramuscular]] (IM)
	- [[Subcutaneous (SC)|Subcutaneous]] (SC)
3. Other
	- [[Respiratory (Pulmonary) route|Inhalation]]
	- [[Nasal route|Intranasal]]
	- Intrathecal / Intraventricular
	- Topical
	- [[Transdermal]]
## Absorption of drugs
A drug from its site of administration to the blood stream.
1. Transport of drug from the GI tract
	- [[Passive diffusion​]]: The drug moves from higher to lower concentration.
	- [[Active transport​]]: This mode of drug entry involves specific carrier proteins that span the membrane; energy-dependent and against concentration gradient.
2. Effect of pH on drug absorption
	- Passive of an uncharged drug through a membrane
	- Determination of how much drug will be found on either side of a membrane
3. Physical factors influencing absorption
	- Blood flow to the absorption site
	- Total surface area available for absorption
	- Contact time at the absorption surface
## [[Bioavailability]]
## Drug distribution
1. Blood flow
2. Capillary permeability:
	- Capillary permeability is determined by capillary structure and by the chemical nature of the drug
	- Capillary structure
	- Blood-brain barrier
	- Drug structure
## Volume of distribution
1. **Water compartments in the body**
	- Plasma compartment: 
		- A drug has a very large molecular weight or binds extensively to plasma proteins, thus is effectively trapped within the plasma (vascular) compartment.
	- Extracellular fluid:
		- The drug has a low molecular weight but is hydrophilic.
	- Total body water
		- If the drug has a low molecular weight and is hydrophobic.
	- Other sites:
		- In pregnancy, the fetus may take up drugs and thus increase the V<sub>d</sub>.
2. **Binding of drugs to proteins**
	- Plasma albumin is the major drug-binding protein and may act as a drug reservoir
## Binding of drugs to plasma proteins
1. Binding capacity of albumin
2. Competition for binding between drugs
	- Class I drugs
	- Class II drugs:
		- These drugs are given in doses that greatly exceed the number of albumin binding sites.
## [[Drug metabolism]]
## Drug elimination
The most important being through the kidney into the urine. Other routes include the bile, intestine, lung, or milk in nursing mothers
1. Renal elimination of a drug
	- Glomerular filtration
	- Proximal tubular secretion
	- Distal tubular reabsorption
	- Role of [[drug metabolism]]
## Clinical situations resulting in increased drug half-life
The half-life of a drug is increased by:
1. Diminished renal plasma flow
2. Addition of a second drug that displaces the first from albumin.
3. Decreased metabolism.
