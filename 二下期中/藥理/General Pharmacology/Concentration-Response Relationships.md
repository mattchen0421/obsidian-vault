- Effective dose (ED<sub>50</sub>)
- Lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>)
- Efficacy: The maximal response produced by a drug (y-axis).
- Potency: Also termed effective dose concentration (x-axis).
- Therapeutic index: $LD_{50}\over ED_{50}$ 
- Reversible antagonists
	- Competitive:
		- These agents interact with receptors at the same site as the agonist and, thus, compete for binding of the agonist
	- Noncompetitive:
		- Decrease the maximal response
- Tolerance
- Tachyphylaxis
- Placebo effect
