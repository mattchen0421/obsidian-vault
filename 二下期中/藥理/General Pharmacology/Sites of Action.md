- **Receptor**
	- ==membrane protein==
	- cytoplasmic 
	- extracellular enzyme
	- nucleic acid
- **Receptors and ligand bonding theory** 
	- The term receptor is usually reserved for proteins, which are imbedded in a cellular or subcellular membrane and facilitate communication between the two sites of the membrane
- **Common features of membrane receptor**
	- Receptors are proteins having one or more binding sites
	- Binding of the endogenous ligand activates the receptor
	- The magnitude of the transmembrane signal depends on the fraction of total receptors occupies by the ligand
	- Drugs can enhance, diminish, or block the generation, transmission, or receipt of ligand-generate signals by several mechanisms
- **Agonist**
	- A drug or ligand that binds to the same site as the endogenous ligand and produces the same signal
- **Antagonist**
	- A drug that binds to the site used by the endogenous ligand and acts competitively to diminish or block the signal produced by the endogenous ligand
- **mechanisms for signal transmission**
	1. Receptors that control ion channels.
	2. Receptors coupled to G-proteins to regulate generation of intracellular second messengers.
	3. Receptors that are internalized to deliver receptors, ligands, or receptor-ligand complexes to intracellular targets.
	4. Receptors with intrinsic enzyme activity
- **Receptor desensitization and turnover**
	- **Tachyphylaxis** (for the drug):
		- also named “acute tolerance”
		- Loss of response in an organ after repeated exposure to an agonist.
	- **Desensitization** (for the receptor):
		- Decrease in the responsiveness of a receptor-transmembrane signaling mechanism
