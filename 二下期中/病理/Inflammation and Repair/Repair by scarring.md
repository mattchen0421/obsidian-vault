- Inflammation
- Cell proliferation:
	- epithelial cells, 
	- endothelial 
	- vascular cells (angiogenesis), 
	- fibroblasts (collagen fibers)
		- Growth factors: 
			TGF-beta; PDGF and FGF
- Remodeling
	- Repair process is a balance between synthesis and degradation of ECM proteins
	- MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases):
		degradation of collagens and other ECM components
	- TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases):
		inhibite MMPs
