1. Vascular changes
	- Vasodilation and increased vascular permeability
	- Bring blood cells and proteins to sites of infection or injury
	- Increased vascular permeability: endothelial contraction, [[necrosis]] due to severe injury
	- Transudates and Exudates
2. Cellular events
	- Leukocyte Recruitment

	- Leukocyte Activation
		1. Phagocytosis of particles
		2. Intracellular destruction of phagocytosed microbes and dead cells
		3. Liberation of substances that destroy extracellular microbes and dead tissues: NETs
		4. Production of mediators
