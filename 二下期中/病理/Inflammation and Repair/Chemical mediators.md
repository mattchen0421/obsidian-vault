## Vasoactive amines
1. Histamine
	- trauma, C3a, C5a, IL1
	- arteriolar dilation and increased permeability
	- inactivated by histaminase
2. Serotonin
	- platelet
	- inducing vasoconstriction during clotting
## Arachidonic acid metabolites
1. Prostaglandins 
2. Leukotrienes: 
	- neutrophils 
3. Lipoxins:
	- leukocytes entering tissues
	- endogenous antagonists of leukotirene
## Platelet-Activating Factor (PAF):
- phospholipid derived mediator
- bronchostriction
- potent vasodilation
- increased vascular permeability
## Cytokines:
- TNF, IL-1, IL-6, interferon-gamma, IL-12
## Chemokines
## Reactive Oxygen Species:
- low-amplifying inflammatory mediators
- high level-tissue damage
## Nitric Oxide
## Plasma protein
- Complement:
	- C1-C9
	- Critical step: C3 activation
- Kinins:
	- bradykinin-pain
	- increased vascular permeability
	- bronchoconstriction
- Proteases:
	- activated during coagulation
