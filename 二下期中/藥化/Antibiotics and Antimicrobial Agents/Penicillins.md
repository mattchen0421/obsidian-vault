aliases: Penicillin
---
- interfere with the last step of bacterial [[cell wall]] synthesis (transpeptidation or cross-linkage)
- only ==effective== against rapidly ==growing organisms== that synthesize a peptidoglycan [[cell wall]].
- cell lysis $\rightarrow$ ==bactericidal==
- inactive against organisms mycobacteria, protozoa, fungi, and viruses
- Early commercial penicillin – yellow to brown amorphous powder
- ==Unstable==; refrigeration was required.
- Crystalline penicillin must be ==protected from moisture==
- ==Salt form== – stable (in general, sodium and potassium salt)
- ==Unpleasant taste==
- ==Natural== penicillins are strongly ==dextrorotatory==.
- Most penicillins are acids – pKa : 2.5-3.0, some are amphoteric.
- Free acids – not suitable for [[Oral (口服用藥)|oral]] or [[Parenteral (via injection)|parenteral]]

## Mechanism of action
- inhibition of bacterial [[cell wall]] synthesis
	- inhibition of transpeptidase
- irreversible inhibition
- Penicillin becomes covalently linked to the enzyme’s active site by means of an ester link to a serine residue
- Penicillin is not split in two and acts as a steric shield to prevent access of substrate or water to the active site

## Trivial nomenclature
1. the first of the therapeutic penicillin :: benzyl penicillin ([[Penicillin G (Benzylpenicillin)]])
2. the first [[Oral (口服用藥)|oral]] penicillin :: phenoxymethyl penicillin ([[Penicillin V (Phenoxymethylpenicillin)]])
3. [[methicillin]] (2,6-dimethoxyphenylpenicillin)

## Degradation of penicillins
- Acid – Penicillenic acid
- Base – Penicilloic acid
- Penicillenic acid + H2O

## Penicillinases
1. $\beta$-lactamase
2. acylase

## Penicillin Analogues
1. By fermentation  
	- Vary the carboxylic acid in the fermentation medium           
	- Limited to unbranched acids at the a-position i.e.     
	- RCH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H
	- Tedious and slow
2. By total synthesis    
	- Only 1% overall yield
	- Impractical
3. By semi-synthetic procedures
	-  Use a naturally occurring structure as the starting  material for analogue synthesis
