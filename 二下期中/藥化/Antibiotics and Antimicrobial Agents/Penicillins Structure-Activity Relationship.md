- Stability of acid media with improved oral absorption results from the addition of electron withdrawing groups in the R<sub>1</sub> substituent at C6, which ==reduces the electron density== around the carbonyl oxygen 
- e.g., –O- in Pen-V; =NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> and aromatic ring in ampicillin and amoxicillin, but not –COO- in ticarcillin
- Addition of bulky substituents at R<sub>1</sub> hinders access of penicillinase ($\alpha$ $\beta$-lactamase) to the $\beta$-lactam carbonyl to reduce $\beta$-lactam hydrolysis, thus improving activity of the drug to $\beta$-lactamase producing bacteria

- Addition of an $\alpha$-ionizable group to R<sub>1</sub> (carboxylate or ammonium) improves activity toward both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.

- An ==ureido group== at the $\alpha$-position of R<sub>1</sub>, as in mezlocillin and piperacillin, increases the spectrum of activity toward both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.
- The ureido side chain does not protect the $\beta$-lactam from penicillinase nor are any of the nitrogen atoms in the ureido basic, and therefore, they are ==not ionizable== at physiological pH.
