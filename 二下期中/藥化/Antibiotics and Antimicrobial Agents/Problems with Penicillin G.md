## Sensitivity
### Reasons for sensitivity
- Acyl side chain
	- Neighbouring group participation in the hydrolysis mechanism

### Strategy
- Vary the acyl side group (R) to make it electron-withdrawing to decrease the nucleophilicity of the carbonyl oxygen

### Example
- Better acid stability and orally active
- But sensitive to $\beta$-lactamases
- Slightly less active than [[Penicillin G (Benzylpenicillin)]]
- Allergy problems with some patients
