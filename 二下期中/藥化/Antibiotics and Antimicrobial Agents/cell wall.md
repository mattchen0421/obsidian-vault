- Not found in mammalian cell
- Most bacterial cell walls contain ==peptidoglycan==, a polymer of modified sugars cross-linked by short polypeptides (peptidoglycan cell wall).

## Gram-positive
- have simpler cell walls,
- large amounts of peptidoglycans
- dense layer
- lipoteichoic acid, wall teichoic acid and surface proteins
- PBPs 
	- important in construction and repair of the cell wall at least seven types of PBPs
- $\beta$-lactam antibiotics bind to these agents and kill bacteria by preventing the biosynthesis of a functional cell wall
- lactamases $\rightarrow$ $\downarrow$ [[Penicillins|penicillin]]
## Gram-negative
- have more complex cell walls 
- less peptidoglycan
- lipopolysaccharides, carbohydrates
