- diazabicyclooctanes (DBOs)
- Recarbrio$^\textregistered$
- act as $\beta$-lactamase inhibitors by virtue of reaction of the active-site serine hydroxyl opening the imidazolidin-2-one ring with formation of a carbamate.
- does not possess antibacterial activity, but rather protects [[imipenem]] from inactivation through $\beta$-lactamase hydrolysis.
- Pharmacokinetics: 
	- binds weakly to plasma protein (22%) and is eliminated primarily via the kidney unchanged.

## Mechanism of action
- It is reported that the acyl complex A lasts up to 24 hours on acylation of KPC-2 producing Enterobacteriaceae $\beta$-lactamase.
- The spectrum of activity of relebactam includes serine $\beta$-lactamases Sulhydryl Variable (SHV), Temorneira (TEM), Cefotazimase-Munich (CTX-M), Enterobacter cloaeae P99 (P99), Pseudomonas-derived cephalosporinase (PDC), and Klebsiella pneumoniae carvapenemase (KPC).
