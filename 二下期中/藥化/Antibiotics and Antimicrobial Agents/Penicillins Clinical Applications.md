- ==The benzyl penicillins== (penicillin G and penicillin V) are used primarily against susceptible ==gram-positive== cocci. ==Infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and genitourinary tract== are commonly treated with these penicillins although resistance is a common problem.
- ==The amino penicillin class== of penicillins (i.e. ampicillin and amoxicillin) show increase activity against ==gram-negative== bacteria because of the $\alpha$-amino substituent. These drugs find benefit in treating Haemophilus influenza and Neisseria gonorrhoeae infections in addition to common gram-positive infection associated with pneumococcal, streptococcal, and meningococcal infections.
- Drugs of the methicillin class (i.e. dicloxacillin, nafcillin, oxacillin) are valuable to treat penicillinase-producing Staphylococcus aureus ==MRSA==). The methcillin class of drugs is generally ==less potent== than benzyl penicillins against ==gram-positive== bacteria.
- ==Ticarcillin==, a member of the carboxypenicillins, has improved ==gram-negative== activity and can be used in combinations for treatment of ==Pseudomonas aeruginosa== infections.
- The ureido penicillin is a broad spectrum antibiotic with activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
