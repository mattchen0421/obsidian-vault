## Mechanism of Bacterial Resistance
- Production of b-lactamases (penicillinases)
- Altered penicillin binding proteins (PBP)

## Penicillinase-resistant penicillins
- increasing the steric hindrance at the $\alpha$-carbon of the acyl group $\rightarrow$ increase resistance to staphylococcal $\beta$-lactamase
- Substitutions at the ==ortho== positions of a ==phenyl ring==(2,6-dimethoxy) or the 2 position of a 1-naphthyl system $\rightarrow$ increase the steric hindrance of the acyl group and confer more b-lactamase resistance than shown by the unsubstituted compounds or those substituted at positions more distant from the $\alpha$-carbon.
- e.g. 2-ethoxy nafcillin
- Bulkier substituents are required to confer effective $\beta$-lactamase resistance among five-membered ring heterocyclic derivatives. Thus, 4-isoxazoyl penicillin family required both the 3-aryl and 5-methyl (3-methyl and 5-aryl) for effectiveness against $\beta$-lactamase producing S. aureus.
- With an electronegative substituent in the 3-phenyl group are resistant to acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of the $\beta$-lactamase
