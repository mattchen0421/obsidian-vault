+ PABA and sulfanilamide have similar steric and electronic properties
+ Both molecules contain ==acidic functional groups==
+ both compounds have a similar electronic configuration
+ distance between the ionized acid and the weakly basic amino group is very similar
+ sulfanilamide acts as an antagonist to PABA metabolism in bacteria.
