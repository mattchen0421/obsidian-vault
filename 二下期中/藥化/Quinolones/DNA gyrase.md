- ==bactericidal== via formation of a ternary complex of drug, enzyme, and DNA
- the primary enzyme is organism-specific
- Bacterial DNA
	- tetrameric
       - two A and two B subunits, encoded by the *gyr*A and *gyr*B genes
- DNA gyrase ([[topoisomerase]] II)
	- seems more important to some G-(-) organisms
- [[topoisomerase]] IV 
	- seems more important to some G-(+) organisms
