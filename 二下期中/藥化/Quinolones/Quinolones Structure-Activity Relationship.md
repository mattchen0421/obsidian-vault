- pharmacophore: carboxy-4-pyridone
- Reduction of the 2,3-double bond or the 4-keto group
	- inactivates the molecule
- substitution at C-2
	- interferes with enzyme-substrate complexation
- C-6 fluoro
	- greatly improves antimicrobial activity
	- increases the [[DNA gyrase]]/[[topoisomerase]] IV inhibitory action
- C-8 fluoro
	- improves drug absorption and half-life
	- increases drug-induced photosensitivity
-  C-8 methoxy group 
	- reduces the photosensitivity
- C-7 Heterocyclic substitution
	- improves the spectrum of activity especially against ==gram-negative organisms==
- C-7 piperazinyl group  
	- increases binding to ==central nervous system (CNS)== Î³-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors
	- Alkyl substitution on the piperazine nitrogen is reported to decrease binding to GABA
- N-1 cyclopropyl substitution
	- broaden activity of the quinolones to include activity against atypical bacteria including Mycoplasma, Chlamydia, and Legionella species
- N-1 2,4-difluorophenyl substitution
	- improves antimicrobial potency
	- serious adverse effects
