# Pharmaceutics
- Pharmaceutics is a branch of pharmacy which includes the study of formulation of drug into a [[Commonly used dosage forms|dosage form]]. 
- A systematic approach to get an effective and stable formulation without disturbing its quality 
- Deal with technology involved in large scale manufacturing
# Biopharmaceutics 生物藥劑學 (PK+PD)
- The study of the relationships between physical and chemical properties of the drugs and its dosage forms and the biological effect observed following the administration of the drug in its various dosage forms
- Pharmacodynamics
	- Site/mechanism of action, potency, efficacy
## Pharmacokinetics
- absorption
	- the movement of a drug into the bloodstream
- distribution
	- the movement of drug to and from the blood and various tissues of the body (for example, fat, muscle, and brain tissue) and the relative proportions of drug in the tissues
- metabolism
	- the chemical alteration of a drug by the body. 
	- The body detoxifies itself through inducing chemical changes in the drugs that have been ingested 
	- The body biochemically alters the drugs through biochemical processes like hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction, conjugation
	- [[prodrug]]
- elimination
	- the removal of drugs from the body 
	- All drugs are eliminated from the body in a chemically altered (metabolized) form or by excretion. 
	- Most drugs, particularly water-soluble drugs and their metabolites, are eliminated largely by the kidneys in urine. 
	- The liver and the kidneys are the major elimination organs in the body 
	- Excretion
# [[Commonly used dosage forms|Dosage Form]] Design (Formulation Design)
- Drug substances are rarely administered as pure chemical substances alone and are almost always given as formulated preparations or medicines. 
- Through selective use of these nonmedicinal agents, referred to as inactive ingredients or excipients, dosage forms of various types result. 
- excipient: 賦型劑
- Active ingredient (drug substance) + Inactive ingredient (excipient or additive) $\rightarrow$  [[Commonly used dosage forms|Dosage Form]] (Formulation)
# Objective of [[Commonly used dosage forms|dosage form]] design
- to achieve a predictable therapeutic response to a drug included in a formulations which is capable of large scale manufacture with reproducible product quality 
- to facilitate administration of the drug by the selected routes, appropriate dosage forms, such as tablets, capsules, injections, suppositories, ointments, aerosols, and others, are formulated and prepared
# Functions of excipients (賦型劑)
- solubilize 助溶 
- suspend 懸浮 
- thicken 增稠 
- preserve 防腐保存 
- emulsify 乳化 
- modify dissolution 改變溶離性質 
- improve compressibility 改善壓縮性 
- flavor drug substance 提供香味
# [[Commonly used dosage forms]]
# Selection of the route of administration
- The therapeutic effect (療效) of the drug depends primarily on the route of administration. 
- The recommended dose (建議劑量) of the drug must be established based on the intended route of administration
## old classification
- enteral (via enteral tract) 腸內給藥 
	- [[Oral mucosal routes|sublingual]], oral or [[Rectal route|rectal]] routes 
	- The GI tract has a massive surface area for absorption 
	- Aadvantages 
		- Non-invasive, Ease of drug administration 
	- Disadvantages 
		- must be lipid soluble,
		- can be irritating to the mucosa of the mouth and the gut
- [[Parenteral (via injection)|Parenteral]] (outside enteral tract) 非經腸內給藥 
	- [[Respiratory (Pulmonary) route|inhalation]], intravenous, intra-arterial, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, ocular, topical, and [[transdermal]] 
	- Advantages 
		- Fast delivery of the medications (IV, [[Respiratory (Pulmonary) route|inhalation]], and intraarterial routes)
		- Efficient maintenance of therapeutic ranges (IV and intraarterial routes)
