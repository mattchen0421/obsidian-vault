- Bioavailability is the fraction of administered drug that reaches the systemic circulation
- defined as the amount of drug that actually makes it to the intended downstream target 
- $\mathrm{F} = \frac{f_{(oral)}}{f_{(iv)}}$
- Factors influencing bioavailability 
	- [[First-pass effect|First Pass Effect]] 
	- Route of administration 
	- Lipid solubility of the drug 
	- Blood flow at the administrations
	- Chemical instability
	- Nature of the drug formulation
- Therapeutic equivalence
	- Two similar drugs are therapeutically equivalent if they have comparable efficacy and safety
