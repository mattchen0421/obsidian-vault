在口服給藥後，許多藥物從小腸完整吸收並首先經由門靜脈系統運送至肝臟，在那裡進行廣泛的代謝
- Some medications are designed to be inactive in the pill form. Once these medications pass into the liver (First-Pass Effect) they are cleaved into their biologically active intermediate forms. These drugs are called prodrugs. 
- During First-Pass Effect, a certain percentage of the drug is changed from the original mother compound into some intermediate metabolite. All of the drug then passes out into the systemic circulation as 
	1. the intact drug plus its 
	2. changed intermediates. 
- Some drugs are almost completely removed from the circulation on their first passage through the liver. If metabolism is extensive, the [[Oral (口服用藥)|oral]] administration leads to much lower drug levels than other routes 
- e.g., nitroglycerin, [[Lidocaine and Prilocaine|lidocaine]], [[isoproterenol]], [[morphine]], [[aspirin]] 
- If these drugs are given orally, the required dose is much greater than for other [[routes of administration]]
