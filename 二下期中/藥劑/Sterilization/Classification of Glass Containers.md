## Type I 
- 硼矽酸鹽玻璃 (silicon dioxide + boric oxide) 
- All products 
- Chemically resistant glass and low thermal coefficient of expansion 
## Type II 
- a soda-lime treated glass 
- Solutions (pH <7.0), dry powders, oil solutions 
## Type III  
- a soda-lime glass 
- Anhydrous liquids or dry substances
## Type NP  
- not suitable for containers for parenteral
---
- Type II & III – chemically less resistant, melt at low temp 
	- easier to mold, higher thermal coefficient of expansion
- Type II treated with sulfur dioxide to increase chemical resistance
