- Sterility(無菌):
	- Absence of life or absolute freedom from biological contamination; 
	- therefore, a product or device is either sterile or it is contaminated
- Asepsis(無菌): 
	- freedom from organisms which produce sepsis(敗血症); 
	- therefore, an aseptic technique does not necessarily imply a sterile technique
- Sterilization(滅菌):
	- ==Inactivation== or ==elimination== of all viable organism and their spores
- Vegetative cell(有繁殖能力的細胞): 
	- Bacterial cell ==capable of multiplication== (as oppose to spore form which cannot multiply). 
	- ==Less resistant== than the spore form
- Spore(芽胞):
	- Body which some species of bacteria form within their cells which is considerably more resistant than the vegetative cell
- Disinfectant(消毒劑): 
	- Substance used on ==non-living== objects to render them non-infectious; kills vegetative bacteria, fungi, viruses but ==Not Spores==.
	- e.g. Formaldehyde
- Bactericide (Germicide, 殺菌劑): 
	- Substance that kills vegetative bacteria and some spores. 
	- e.g. active chlorine, surfactants
- Bacteriostat(抑菌劑): 
	- Substance which stops growth and multiplication of bacteria but does not necessarily kill them.
	- Growth usually resumes when bacteriostat is removed.
	- e.g. sodium azide
- Antiseptic(防腐劑):
	- Substance used to ==prevent multiplication of microorganism== when applied to living systems.
	- An antiseptic is bacteriostatic in action but not necessarily bacteriocidal
