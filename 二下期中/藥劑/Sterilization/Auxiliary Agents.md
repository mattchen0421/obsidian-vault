## Buffers
### Boric Acid Vehicle 
- 1.9% solution of boric acid in purified water. Isotonic with tears 
- pH: ~ 5 
- Buffering capacity: not strong 
- For drugs that are most stable at acid pH
### Phosphate Buffer NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>
- Not isotonic 
- Buffering capacity: large 
- pH: 6.5 â€“ 8.0
## Tonicity adjustors
- Buffer solution 
- Common neutral tonicity adjustor 
	- Sodium chloride
	- sodium nitrate
	- sodium sulfate
	- dextrose 
- Osmolarity: 300 mOsm/L (ideal)
