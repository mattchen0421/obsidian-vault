- a reliable sterilization method that does not cause physicochemical instability
- determine that the drug is safe in the dose prescribed if administered by injection 
- use pyrogen-free chemically pure solvent, adjuvants and drugs 
- avoid excessively acidic (pH < 3), alkaline (pH > 11), and otherwise toxic solvents  
- clarify the final solution through 0.45 mm membrane or simultaneously sterilize and clarify it through 0.22 mm membrane into a sealed sterile vial under aseptic conditions 
- package the solution in a compatible, appropriate container
- conservatively assign the expiration date based on potential microbial growth and physicochemical stability
- explicitly label the final product as to contents, sterility, single or multiple use container, injection route, storage conditions, lot number, and expiration date
