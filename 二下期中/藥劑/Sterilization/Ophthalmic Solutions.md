> Ophthalmic solutions are sterile solutions, essentially free from foreign particles, suitably compounded and packaged for instillation into the eye
## Administration considerations
- Avoid contamination 
- Provide accurate dosage 
- Keep eye open for at least 30 seconds for eye drops 
## Bioavailability
- Tear volume: 7 mL 
- Commercial eye drops: 50-75 mL 
- Maximum volume of cul-de-sac: 30 mL + drainage capacity 
- Ideally high concentration and low volume 
- Difficulties:
	- Design of a small volume dropper 
	- Absorption primarily through cornea 
	- Ointment increase contact time and bioavailability
## Ophthalmic ointments 
- A popular form of ophthalmic delivery 
- Longer contact time -> greater bioavailability 
- Drug release is a function of concentration, solubility and diffusivity in the ointment base 
- Typical bases: 
	- white petrolatum, mineral oil, anhydrous lanolin 
- Concerns: 
	- dosage variability and interference with vision 
- Sterilization particularly difficult
## Ophthalmic suspensions 
- Dispersions of insoluble drugs using suspending agents 
- Higher residence time than solution 
- Absorption from soluble particles 
- Optimum particle size to facilitate dissolution and prevent irritation: < 10mm 
- Optimum intrinsic solubility for timely dissolution 
- Shaking the suspension: 
	- Critical advice to patient
## Ophthalmic solutions
- Most common 
- All ingredients in solution, uniformity not a problem 
- Little physical interference with vision 
- Disadvantage: 
	- brief contact 
- Addition of viscosity agents: 
	- ==methylcellulose==
### Ophthalmic solution characteristics
- Site of application determines, to a large extent, the formulation design criteria  
- **Clarity (澄明)**: 
	- particulate free 
- **Stability**: 
	- drug and pH dependent 
- **Buffer and pH**: 
	- balance of comfort and stability 
- **Tonicity**: 
	- eye is more tolerant 
- **Viscosity**: 
	- increase contact time. 
	- e.g., methylcellulose 
- **Additives**: 
	- antioxidants, surfactants, preservatives
### Desired properties of ophthalmic solutions
- **terility and clarity**: 
	- absolute requirement 
	- Using aseptic technique 
	- Filtration 
- **Preservative**: 
	- for multidose prep. used > 24 hr 
- **pH**: 
	- 7.4 (ideal)
	- 6.5 – 8.5 normal range 
- **Isotonic with tears**: 
	- preferred 
- **Sterile ophthalmic products**: 
	- contact lens solutions, corticosteroid suspension products, etc.
