## Ultraviolet Light Radiation Sterilization
- Penetration of ultraviolet light is negligible; therefore, its bactericidal effectiveness is limited to exposed surfaces. 
- Application:
	- Used to reduce the level or airborne contamination and maintain sterility of work surfaces and equipment, such as laminar flow. 
- Equipment:
	- Ultraviolet Lamp (wavelength: ==2537Ã…==) 
- Disadvantages: 
	- Highly specialized equipment required 
	- Effect of irradiation on products and their containers
## Ionizing Radiation
- Radioactive isotopes: 
	- Cobalt60 (Gamma rays) or mechanical acceleration of electrons to very high velocities (cathode or beta rays), etc 
- The penetrability depends on: 
	- type and energy of specific radiation 
	- Density of the substance being irradiated 
- Equipment: 
	- Ionization (Beta Rays, Gamma Rays, X-Rays) 
- Disadvantages: 
	- Highly specialized equipment required, 
	- Gamma rays are not readily available, emission cannot be controlled or stopped, but is possible with a mechanical source
### Electron Accelerators
- Theoretically capable of unlimited energy generation 
- Ionizing radiations interfere with the reproductive process of microorganism by lethal mutations, by 
	1. direct contact and transfer of radiation energy to receptive bacterial molecules, such as electron accelerators, or 
	2. indirect action, whereby hydrogen and hydroxyl ions are formed and interact with nucleic acids and other molecules
- Survival of microorganisms after exposure to ionizing radiation has not been shown to occur. Bacterial spores and viruses are more resistant than vegetative cells, requiring 4 to 5 times the dose to ensure complete destruction of the microorganism. 
- Application: 
	- surgical sutures, plastic iv sets, some vitamins, antibiotics, and hormones in dry state. 
- ==Cannot be used in liquid pharmaceutic==
