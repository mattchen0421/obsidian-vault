## Syringes
- administer sterile preparations via direct intravenous push and other infusion control devices  
	- Example: Analgesics, Antiemetics, Antibiotics 
## Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) 
- Parenteral nutrition is a hypertonic solution of protein, fat, carbohydrates, electrolytes, vitamins, and minerals. 
- Intravenous administration of calories, nitrogen, and other nutrients in sufficient quantities to achieve tissue synthesis and anabolism 
- The normal caloric requirement for an adult is approximately ==2500 kcal== per day (~ 15 L D5W – 5% dextrose in water) 
- To avoid fluid overload, dextrose concentration is increased to 25% (which is hypertonic!) 
- TPN is administered via superior vena cava
- Carbohydrates (glucose), protein (a.a.), lipids (triglycerides), electrolyts, vitamins and trace minerals
### Preparation of TPN solutions 
- The Automix Accusource compounder pumps dextrose, amino acids, water, or fat, if applicable, into an empty polyvinyl chloride bag.
- The Micromix adds electrolytes and trace elements to the parenteral nutrition solution. 
- Withdraw additional additives manually
