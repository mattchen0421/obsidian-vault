- the degree of ==heat==, the ==duration== of exposure, and the ==humidity==
- ↑Temperature can ↓ duration, but the relationship is not linear. 
- Different microorganism need different protocols
- The mechanism by which microorganisms are killed by heat is thought to depend on the presence of moisture
	- In the presence of moisture, death is due to the ==coagulation of the protein==
	- In the absence of water, ==oxidation== is the primary process
- Moist heat is more effective than dry heat in killing microorganisms, attributed to the ability of moist heat to coagulate the cell protein at a much lower temperature. 
- Additionally, steam has a much greater thermal capacity than hot air
## Dry Heat Sterilization 
- tolerate temperatures higher than 120$\degree$C. 
- Both vegetative cells and spores can be killed by exposure to ==180$\degree$C for 2 hours== or ==260$\degree$C for 45 min==. Dry heat sterilization is often carried out at 160$\degree$C to 170$\degree$C for 2 to 4 hrs
- Equipment: Oven
- Application: 
	- Glassware, metalware, fixed oils, thermostable powders 
	- Cannot be used in many drugs, rubber, plastic mate
- Disadvantages: 
	- Sterilization by means of heat requires higher temperatures and longer exposures than sterilization by steam. 
	- Heat transfer is slow.
	- Many chemicals can undergo decomposition between 120 and 260 $\degree$C
## Steam Sterilization (Autoclaving)
- In the presence of moisture, microorganisms are destroyed at a lower temperature than in dry heat. This is the method of choice when product can withstand such treatment. 
- Equipment: Autoclave
- Applications 
	- Solutions sealed in containers ampul, vials 
	- Bulk solutions 
	- Supplies, including rubber closure, glassware, rubber attachments, filters, sterile room garments, etc 
	- Instruments
- Advantages:
	- Rapid
	- Inexpensive 
	- Effective 
	- Large volumes 
- Disadvantages: 
	- ==Cannot be used for oily preparation (oil base ointment)== 
	- Cannot be used for moisture sensitive preparations or nonaqueous preparations
