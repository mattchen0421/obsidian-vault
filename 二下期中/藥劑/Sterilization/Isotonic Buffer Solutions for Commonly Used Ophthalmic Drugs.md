## Group I – Buffered to pH 5: 
- Consists of drugs that should be maintained at pH 5 in order to retard the rapid formation of the irritating free base and thus allow a more gentle and prolonged action 
---
- Boric Acid USP 1.9 g 
- Benzalkonium chloride 1:10,000 
- Sterile distilled water, to make 100 mL
---
- Drug Included in Group I are salts of: 
	- Cocaine, Dibucaine, Procaine, Tetracaine, Neostigmine, Zinc
## Group IA – Buffered to pH5: 
- A modified boric acid buffer is used for salts of physostigmine, phenylephrine, and epinephrine 
---
- Boric Acid USP 1.9
- Phenylmercuric nitrate 1:50,000 
- Sodium sulfite, anhydrous 0.1 g 
- Sterile distilled water, to make 100 mL
---
- Because of an incompatibility, benzalkonium chloride is replaced with phenylmercuric nitrate. Sodium sulfite is added to prevent discoloration (oxidation) of physostigmine, phenyleprine, and epinephrine
## Group II – Buffered to pH 6.5: 
- Consists of drugs that have their greatest stability at pH 2–3, but at the same time have their minimum therapeutic action at this pH range
