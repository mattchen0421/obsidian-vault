- Used for: 
	- Rapid action 
	- Oral route can not be used 
	- Not effective except as injection 
- Commons: 
	- [[Intravenous (IV)]]
	- [[Intramuscular (IM)]]
	- [[Subcutaneous (SC)]] 
- Others: 
	- [[Intradermal (ID)]]
	- [[Intra-arterial (IA)]]
	- Intraspinal, etc
## Influence of route of administration on formulation
### Incorporating the drug into the appropriate volume 
- Large Volume Parenterals (LVP): 
	- can only be given through IV 
	- single-dose injections containing more than ==100 mL== of solution that are intended for intravenous use
- Small Volume Parenterals (SVP): 
	- $\le$ 100 mL 
	- Either single- or multi-dose products
	- IM, SC < 2 mL 
	- ID < 0.2 mL
	- IV 
### Single-dose and Multiple-dose
- Single-dose products: 
	- IV., intraspinal, intrathecal, etc 
	- Could be SVP or LVP
	- Multiple-dose products: 
		- SC., IM., ID., etc 
		- Generally, cannot exceed 10 single-doses in one multiple dose product 
		- Total volume < 30mL
### Solvent systems 
- IV and Intraspinal: 
	- dilute aqueous solutions 
- IM and SC: 
	- solution, oily solution, emulsions, and suspensions 
### Isotonicity 
- IM and SC: 
	- do not require isotonic solution 
- IV: 
	- do not require isotonic solution 
- ==Intraspinal==: 
	- ==require isotoni==
