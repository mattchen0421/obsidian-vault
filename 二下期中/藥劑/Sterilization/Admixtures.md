## Environment (Class 100 Cleanroom) 
- Laminar Air Flow 
	- the flow of an entire body of air within a confined space moving with uniform velocity of 90±20 fpm along parallel flow lines 
- HEPA (High Efficiency Particulate Air) filters 
	- capable of removing particles of $\ge$ 0.3 mm with an efficiency of at least 99.97%, efficient air flow of HEPA is 100±20 ft/min 
## Additives 
- The additives are injections packaged in ampuls or vials, or sterile solids; the latter are reconstituted with a suitable diluent before addition to the IV fluid 
## Leaker Test (for Ampuls only)
