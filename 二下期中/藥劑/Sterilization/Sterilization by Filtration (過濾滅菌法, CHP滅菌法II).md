- Physical removal of microorganisms by adsorption on the filter medium. Used for heat sensitive materials. 
- Advantages: 
	- Absolute sterilization 
		- separates particles based on size 
	- Used for heat sensitive media 
	- Removal of multiple particle sizes 
	- Allows for fairly high throughput 
- Disadvantages: 
	- Each filter has a specific nominal pore size 
	- Unable to separate microorganisms that have the same size 
	- May require a high differential pressure 
- Application: 
	- Thermolabile solutions of low viscosity
- Red blood cell
