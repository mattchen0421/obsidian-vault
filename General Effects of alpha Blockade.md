- Arteriolar and venous tone are determined to a large extent by receptors on vascular smooth muscle
- Reduction in Blood Pressure: 
	- Blockade of α<sub>1</sub> (also α<sub>2</sub>) receptor causes pooling of blood in capacitance vessels
	- reduced venous return and Cardiac output 
	- fall in mean BP
- Postural Reflex is interfered 
	- dizziness and Syncope on standing
- Vasopressor effects of Adrenaline is not found
## Others
- Reflex tachycardia due to fall in BP and increased NA release due to presynaptic $\alpha$<sub>2</sub> blockade
- Nasal stuffiness and Miosis
- Increased Intestinal Motility 
	- diarrhea
- Reduced GFR: 
	- Sodium retention and increase in blood volume 
	- also reflex renin release
- Tone of the Bladder trigone, sphincter and prostate is maintained by α<sub>1A</sub> sympathetic
- Blockade produces increased urine flow
- Inhibition of Ejaculation 
	- due to inhibition of contraction of vas deferens and others
