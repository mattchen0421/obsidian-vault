- Highly selective $\alpha$<sub>1</sub> blocker (1:1000)
- ==Non-specific blockade of all subtypes== - α<sub>1A</sub>, α<sub>1B</sub> and α<sub>1D</sub>
- Blockade of sympathetic vasoconstriction - fall in BP
- ==NA is not released as α<sub>2</sub> is not blocked (only mild tachycardia)
- Dilates arterioles more than veins 
	- Postural hypotension is less 
	- only 1st dose effect (dizziness and fainting)
- Also inhibits PDE 磷酸二酯酶
	- rise in smooth muscle cAMP 
	- vasodilatation
- Kinetics: 
	- effective orally (70%), metabolized in liver and half life is 6-8 Hrs
- Uses: 
	- Hypertension, Raynaud's disease, BHP
