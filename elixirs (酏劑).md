## Elixirs (酏劑)
- Of the official liquid preparations for oral administration, elixirs probably are used the most widely, due to their pleasant flavor, their relative stability, and the ease of preparation.

	- several official elixirs do not contain sugar or any other sweetening agent while some others do not contain alcohol.  
- ==Glycerin== is present in most elixirs but was replaced by propylene glycol during WW II.
	- 助溶
