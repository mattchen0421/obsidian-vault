## Infection
1. Adsorption of virion to host cell plasma membrane receptors
2. Entry of virion into host cell (akin to phagocytosis)
3. Uncoating of virion (removal of protein capsid, exposure of viral nucleic acid to initiate replication)
## Replication
1. Viral DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (DNA virus) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNA viruses) catalyze the synthesis of mRNAs for production of viral structural and nonstructural proteins
2. Viral genome may integrate into host chromosome
3. Modification of viral proteins by glycosylation and cleavage 
## Release
1. Assembly of virions
2. Slow leakage from host cell (budding), or cell rupture
