- is found in both influenza A and B viruses and is thought to be involved in catalytically cleaving glycosidic bonds between a terminal sialic acid and an adjacent sugar
- Cleavage of sialic acid bonds facilitates the spread of viruses and as a result increases the infectiveness or pathogenicity of the virus
- NA appears to be involved in preventing viral inactivation by respiratory mucus and induction of cytokine elaboration
- Viruses are bounded to the NA through the sialic acid and the NA cleaves the sialic moiety
