## Syrups (糖漿劑)
- Syrups are sweet, viscous aqueous liquids 
- Flavoring syrups 矯味糖漿
	- used as vehicles
- Medicated syrups 含藥糖漿
	- contain ingredients with therapeutic value 
- Used for antibiotics, antihistamines, antitussives, sedatives, vitamines, etc. 
- From pharmaceutical point of view, it can be categorized as glycogenic (with sugar) and non-glycogenic (with artificial sweetening) syrups. The latter is for DM and obesity patients’ use. 
- Only ==sucrose== and ==glucose== (in natural sugars) can be used in the preparation of syrups.

- **This reaction is called inversion** 
	- Solutions of invert sugars are fermented more easily 
	- Invert sugars are sweeter than sucrose 
	- dextrose(glucose)
		- ==右旋糖==
	- levulose(fructose)
		- 左旋糖
	- Degradation of the fructose seems to be responsible for the brown discoloration
		- caramelization 
- **Imcompatibility** 
	- Sucrose will crystallize while mix with high conc. of alcohol (>10%). 
	- Gellation凝膠化 is observed while mixing pectin with sucrose syrups.
## Syrup, U.S.P. (單糖漿, simple syrup)
- ==85% w/v of sucrose, Sp. Gr. 1.313== 
- Simple syrup is a saturated solution of sucrose at 4$\degree$C, therefore, no crystallization should be observed in a properly prepared syrup, unless the temperature drops below 4$\degree$C. 
- If the syrup is too concentrat → crystallization
- If the syrup is too diluted → growth of molds
- Generally, syrups should store at room temp. in tightly stopped well-filled containers
## preservatives
- Sucrose is subject to two degradative pathways in aq solution: 
	- Fermentation and hydrolysis 
- As a carbohydrate, sucrose in dilute aq solution provides a nutrient medium for microorganism growth. 
- Turbidity, fermentation, change of taste 
- Nearly saturated sucrose, if stored properly, are self-preserving 
- According to U.S.P., preservatives should be added to the syrup containing less than 85% w/v of sucrose. Some preservatives suitable for use in syrup are summarized.

## Calculations for syrups
- The amount of added preservative needed in syrups may be estimated from the calculated “free water”. The more free water, the more preservative required in this product
- example
	- how much free water in 100 mL of a 65% w/v sucrose?
	- 65:x = 85:100
	- x: the volume of water that doesn’t need preservative 
	- 85% w/v saturated sucrose, doesn’t have free water, contain 100 mL water that doesn’t need preservative
	- x= 76.5mL
	- which means that The free water in this solution is 100-76.5 = 23.5mL
- if the syrup already has glycerin in it, glycerin will occupy twice volume of its concentration. 
	- For example, if the syrup contains 5% glycerin, In 100 mL syrup, it will occupy 10 mL of free water
## Preparation of syrups
- **Hot process (Solution with heat @ 100$\degree$C)** 
	- For non-volatile and heat-stable compound 
	- Sterilization 
	- Syrup, U.S.P. 
- **Agitation without heat** 
	- For volatile or heat unstable compound 
	- Lemon syrup 
- **Addition of a medicating liquid to syrup or vice versa** 
	- Cherry syrup, raspberry syrup 
- **Percolation滲濾** 
	- Syrup, U.S.P., Tolu Balsam Syrup, Wild Cherry Syrup, Ipecac Syrup
### Examples of syrup preparation 
#### Syrups prepared by simple admixture
- **Glycyrrhiza Syrup, U.S.P. (甘草糖漿劑)** 
	- Made by the addition of simple syrup to a blend of fennel oil 甜茴香精油 and anise oil 大茴香油 dissolved in fluidextract glycyrrhiza. 
- Same method can be applied to the preparation of medicinal syrups. The amount of drug used is such that a dose is obtained in 5mL. 
- Hydrocodone Bitartrate Syrup, U.S.P., and Ipecac Syrup, U.S.P.
#### by dissolving sucrose in solution of ingredients
- Most official syrups are prepared by this method rather and simple admixture. 
- Cherry and Raspberry Syrup, U.S.P. (櫻桃與覆盆子糖漿) 
- Made by dissolving sucrose in the appropriate juice. A small quantity of alcohol is added to inhibit growth of surface molds. 
- Tolu Balsam Syrup, N.F., Senna Syrup, N.F., Wild Cherry Syrup, U.S.P., Acacia Syrup, N.F., Cocoa Syrup, U.S.P., [[Ephedrine]] Sulfate Syrup, U.S.P., Ferrus Sulfate Syrup, N.F., Hydroiodic Acid Syrup, N.F.
## Formulation of “Artificial” Syrups
### Non-nutritive Syrups 
- Designed to be administered to persons who must regulate their sugar and/or calorie intake accurately 
- Diabetes mellitus (DM) or obesity patient 
- Diabetic Simple Syrup:
	- Sodium carboxymethylcellulose 1.5%
	- Sweetening agent q.s. 
	- Preservative q.s.
	- Water q.s. 
### Sorbitol-based syrups
- 70% w/w Sorbitol Solution U.S.P. 
- Require preservative if conc. < 60% w/w
- Advantages of sorbitol 
	- Not irritating to mucosa. 
	- Does not contribute to dental caries 
	- Absorption in GI is slower than sugars 
	- Excellent “mouth feel” qualities 
	- Compatible with other polyols and simple syrup 
	- stable 
- Disadvantages of sorbitol 
	- Less sweeter, not very viscous, may have a laxative effect after digesting of excessive quantities of sorbitol
