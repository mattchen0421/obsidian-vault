- Miscibility (可混溶性):
	-  the ability of two substances to dissolve in one another in any proportion, usually used in liquid-liquid systems 
- Miscible:
	-  two liquids are capable of dissolving in each other to form a single phase, irrespective of the proportions. 
	- e.g., alcohol and water, glycerin and water, acetone and water 
- Miscible in certain proportions:
	- produce homogeneous systems only when mixed in certain ratios
	- e.g., ether and water, liquid phenol and water 
- Immiscible:
	- practically insoluble in each other in any proportion
	- e.g., mineral oil and water
